The SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein family is a group of transcription factors that are highly conserved across all lineages of land plants. I am currently working on characterizing the function of two cell-death inducing members from tomato, SlySBP8b and SlySBP12a. I am interested in an alignment of the promoter sequences of related SBPs from tomato, Nicotiana benthamiana, and Arabidopsis thaliana as an outgroup. Tomato and N. benthi fasta sequences were obtained from the Sol Genomics Network database, and A. thaliana sequences from TAIR, a dedicated Arabidopsis database. 

Data includes: 16 members from A. thaliana, 16 members from S. lycosperium, and an unknown number from N. benthi

Data is fasta files of assembled genomic sequence data - QC already performed
